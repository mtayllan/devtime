# DevTime

DevTime is a tool for track how much time developers spend while coding on their favorite text editor.

- ⏲️ It tracks how much time you spend in each day of the week
- ↔️ It compares how much time you spend today against your week average
- ☀️🌄🌜 It tracks your activity throughout the day, so you can discover the hour that you produce more code
- And many more features are coming 🚀...

## Application
You can use the application hosted in Heroku. It's in beta, so you can lose all data tracked in the official release.
